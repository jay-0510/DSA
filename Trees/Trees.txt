// TREES - NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE 
It doesnâ€™t store in a sequential manner 
Defined as a collection of objects or entities known as node that are linked together to represent hierarchy.
It is a hierarchial structure as elements in a tree are arranged in multiple levels.

* TOP MOST NODE - root node - Contains some data
Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.

* TOP MOST NODE - root node
* CHILD NODES - child nodes of root node
* GRAND CHILD NODES - child nodes of child nodes (PARENT NODE) 
* GRAND GRAND CHILD NODES - child nodes of grand child nodes (Sibling)

* LEAF NODES - nodes that do not have any child nodes
* INTERIOR NODES - nodes that have child nodes - atleast one child 
* EDGE - connection between two nodes
* DESCENDANT - The immediate successor of given node is called ....

 Properties :
 1. Each node in a tree has at most one parent node (except root node)
 2. Tree is known as recursive data structure, bcoz the distinguished node is a tree data structure...
 3. If there are N nodes then N-1 EDGE
 4. Heigh node X is longest path from the node X to be leaf node.
