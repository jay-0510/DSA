//RECURSION --- 
when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met. 

// Infinite Recursion - calling function again and again 

//STACK OVERFLOW - 
when numerous function calls are waiting due to recursion. 
Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack.
If the recursion stack is full, it leads to a stack overflow error. (Segmentation fault error)
