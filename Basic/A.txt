Basic terms need to remember :

//Loop conditionals -- 
1. for and while loops - question solving 
2. % - use for finding remainders, check divisibility, and extract digits.
3. Division / can be used in conjunction with % to break down numbers.

//Modulo and Divison Operations -- 
4. Divisors: Check if n % i == 0.
5. Palindrome and Reverse: Use % to get digits and / to remove the last digit.

//  Mathematical formulas and concepts. 
6. GCD: Use the Euclidean algorithm for efficient computation.
7. LCM: Use LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
8. Factorial: Use iterative multiplication up to n.

//Digit manipulation
9. Sum of Digits: Continuously extract the last digit and add it to a sum.
10.Armstrong Number: Raise each digit to the power of the number of digits and sum the results.
11.Palindrome: Reverse the number using digit manipulation and check if it matches the original.

// Recursive Logic 
12. Factorial: Use recursive multiplication up to n.
13. Fibonacci: Use recursive addition up to n.
14. Binary to Decimal: Use recursive multiplication up to n.
15. Decimal to Binary: Use recursive division up to n.


// looping, modulo operations, digit manipulation, mathematical concepts, arrays, recursion, and edge casesâ€”are essential for approaching many coding problems.
