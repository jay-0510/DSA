SPACE COMPLEXITY :

Memory space in ehich program takes to run -- (Naive form)
Memory space in which program takes to run -- (Optimized form)

Auxiliary Space + Input Space 
Auxiliary Space - Space that you taken to solve the problem
Input Space - Space that you already have (to store input)

eg: c = a + b 
Auxiliary Space = 1 (for storing c)
Input Space = 2 (for storing a and b)
Total Space = 1 + 2 = 3 ----- O(3) - Total Time Complexity
