// Select minimum and swap 
// It is simplest algorithm 
// Simple and easy to element
Algorithm is divided into two parts - Sorted part and Unsorted part 
  {Sorted part is empty}     {Unsorted part is given array}

Average Time Complexity - O(n2)
Worst Case Complexity - O(n2)
Space Complexity - O(1)
