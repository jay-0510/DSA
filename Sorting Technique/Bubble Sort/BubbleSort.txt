// Pushes maximum to the last by adjacent side
This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
// Movemnent of array is just like movement of air bubbles in water - bubble sort

Best Case:  O(n)  array is already sorted.
Worst Case:  O(n^2)  for a completely reversed array
Average Case:  O(n^2)  for a random array
Space Complexity:  O(1) .
