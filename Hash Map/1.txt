HASP MAP - process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. 

HASH MAP - stores data in key-value pairs using a hashing mechanism.
- It allows fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion based on hash codes.
- It uses a hashing technique to efficiently retrieve, insert, and delete data in constant average time complexity  O(1) .


HASHING : It's the process of converting a key into an integer (hash code) using a hash function.
- Use to determine an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure. 
- If two keys produce the same hash code (collision), a collision-handling mechanism like chaining is used.


Applications :
1. Data Integrity
2. Database Indexing
3. Cryptography 
4. Caches 
5. Symbol table and Dictionaries 

* mainly two forms of hash typically implemented in programming languages
1. Hash Set     2. Hash Map 

* Components 
1. Key :  Key can be anything string or integer which is fed as input in the hash function the technique that determines an index or location
2. Hash Function :  Receives the input key and returns the index of an element in an array ..... (hash Index)
3. Hash Table : Hash table is typically an array of lists. It stores values corresponding to the keys.


Advantages :
1. fast retrieval and Insertion 
2. Handle large data set efficiently

Disadvantages : 
1. Requires more memory 
2. Performance depends on hash function quality.
3. Not thread-safe
