// Circular Doubly Linked List 
Its a type of linked list in which the first & the last nodes are also connected to each other to form circle.
There is no NULL at the end. 


* Circular :  circular doubly linked listâ€™s main feature is that it is circular in design.
* Doubly Linked :  In a doubly linked list, each node has two pointers, one pointing to node before it and other pointing of the node after it
* Header Node : start of circular doubly linked lists, a header node or sentinel node is frequently used. 

Applications : 
1. Music player playlist 
2. Cache memory management 
3. Implementing undo - redo operations 

Advantages :
1. Efficient insertion and deletion
2. Fast traversal
3. Memory efficient
4. Easy to implement circular data structure

Disadvantages :
1. Complexity 
2. Cost of circularity 
3. More complex to debug
