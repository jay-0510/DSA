// Arrays - linear Data structure 
// Arrays is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
// Arrays are used to store a collection of data of the same type in a single variable.
Type : Integer, String, Char, 

* Mainly advantage - Random access & Cache friendliness
* Mainly disadvantage - Fixed size & Insertion/deletion is costly
* Array at core are at fixed size only. 

Array is store in 0 index of arrays 
X, X+1, X+2, X+3, X+4 == is called contiguous locations

Advantages :
1. Efficient and fast access
2. Memory efficiency
3. Versality
4. Compatibility with hardware

Disadvantages :
1. Fixed size
2. Memory allocation 
3. Insertion and deletion is costly & Challenging
4. Limited data type support
5. Not suitable for large data sets

For arrays :
for (i=0; i<n; i++)
{
    print (arr[]); 
}
