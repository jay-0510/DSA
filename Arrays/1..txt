// Arrays - linear Data structure 
// Arrays is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

* Mainly advantage - Random access & Cache friendliness
* Array at core are at fixed size only. 

Advantages :
1. Efficient and fast access
2. Memory efficiency
3. Versality
4. Compatibility with hardware

Disadvantages :
1. Fixed size
2. Memory allocation 
3. Insertion and deletion is costly & Challenging
4. Limited data type support
5. Not suitable for large data sets
