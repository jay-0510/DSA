// Brute Force - 
// Time Complexity - O(n^2)
// Space Complexity - O(1)

* PROS - 
1. Simple and straight forward 
2. Easy to implement
3. No extra space required


* CONS - 
1. Time Consuming and resource extensive 
2. Not suitable for large inputs
3. ineeficient for large datasets or complex probelms 
4. Not constructive or creative


// Optimal Approach - 
// Time Complexity - O(n)
// Space Complexity - O(1)

1. More efficient and suitable for large inputs and complex problems
2. More constructive and creative than the brute force approach
3. Reduce steps n number of cases
